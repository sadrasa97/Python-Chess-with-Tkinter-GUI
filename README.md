# Python Chess with Tkinter GUI

This is a Python chess implementation with a Tkinter graphical user interface (GUI). The project is built using clean, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity, readability, and extensibility. It includes features such as pawn promotion and en passant.

## Features

- **Clean Code**: The project follows best practices for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. It adheres to the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) to promote modularity and extensibility.

- **Fully Object-Oriented Design**: The chess game logic is implemented using object-oriented design, with classes representing each component of the game such as the board, pieces, players, and moves.

- **Pawn Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (queen, rook, bishop, or knight) chosen by the player.

- **En Passant**: The en passant rule is implemented, allowing a pawn to capture an opponent's pawn if it moves two squares forward from its starting position, bypassing the captured pawn's original position.

- **Tkinter GUI**: The graphical user interface is built using Tkinter, the standard GUI toolkit for Python. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for playing chess.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sadrasa97/Python-Chess-with-Tkinter-GUI.git
   ```

2. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Install Tkinter if not already available.

   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```

3. **Run the Game**: Navigate to the project directory and run the main Python file.

   ```bash
   cd Python-Chess-with-Tkinter-GUI
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Play Chess**: Use the mouse to select and move pieces on the chessboard. Enjoy playing against either a friend or yourself!

## Tips for Playing

- **Mouse Controls**: Click on a piece to select it, then click on a valid square to move the piece to that location.
  
- **Pawn Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, a promotion dialog will appear. Select the desired piece for promotion.
  
- **En Passant**: If your opponent moves a pawn two squares forward from its starting position, you have the option to capture it en passant on the next move.

- **Check and Checkmate**: Keep an eye out for check and checkmate situations. The game will automatically detect and handle these scenarios.

- **Undo Move**: Press the "Undo" button to undo your last move if needed.
